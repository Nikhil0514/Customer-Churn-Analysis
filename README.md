## Churning Factors
1. Young customers are more likely to churn.
2. Customers with less than 12 months tenure are prone to churn.
3. Month-to-month contracts increase churn risk.
4. Subscribing to fiber optic internet and high charges are key factors contributing to churn.
# Suggestions
1. Extending the basic contract plan to 3 months or  6 months can be a good starting point. This will help customers stay for a bit longer with the company.
2. Offer different prices on different contract periods. Or give longer contract customers a special discounts.
3. Starting special offers or schemes for customers who are single and have no family responsibility. They can become permanent customer for the company. 'Catch them Young' is key to success here.
4. Offer family plan, but make sure the family members can be able to choose their own plan individually.(Dependents might not need more services, they can choose as few as one service, but still have the discount price for whole family.
5. Offering basic services like device protection, tech support, online security should be primary goal. This will help the customer stay longer with the brand.
